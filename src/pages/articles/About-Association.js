                                At Girijananda Chowdhury University (GCU), we believe in the value of connections that last a 
                                lifetime. The Girijananda Chowdhury University has evolved in 2022 out of the initiative of the 
                                Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Management and Technology (GIMT) [established in 2006] 
                                and the Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (GIPS) [established in 
                                2007] to impart professional higher education in a spirit of philanthropy and social 
                                commitment. The Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Management and Technology Guwahati 
                                Alumni Association came into existence in 2013 bearing registration number 
                                RS/KAM(M)/263/I/421 of 2014-15. In addition, the Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of

                                naming it ‚ÄòGirijananda Chowdhury University Alumni Association‚Äô (GCUAA) and registered them

                                A University's alumni are the reflection of its past, a representation of its present, and a link to 
                                its future. The primary goal of our Alumni Association is to foster a lifelong relationship between 
                                alumni and their alma mater, facilitating a sense of community and supporting both the 
                                institution and its graduates. GCUAA provides logistics help to students and alumni, organizes 
                                in-house lectures and workshops for students, research scholars, and staff, and organizes 
                                outreach activities in schools and colleges. Donations and financial gifts from alumni make a 
                                direct impact on the future of the University, supporting scholarships, research, and programs 
                                that benefit the next generation of students. In the past, it has collected approximately Rs. 30 
                                lakhs through membership drives and donations. The GCU alums are spread across the globe 
                                and are occupied internationally. The GCUAA has an Alumni Office on the 3rd Floor of the 
                                Admin Building at GCU. The GCUAA has recently contributed Rs. 2 lacs from the association 
                                fund for the University‚Äôs development purposes.
