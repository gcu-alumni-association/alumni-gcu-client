                        <p>Girijananda Chowdhury University (GCU) stands as a testament to the vision and dedication of the Shrimanta Shankar Academy Society. Established in October 2022, GCU marks a significant milestone in Assam's academic landscape, emerging as a private university under the Assam Private University Act following approval by the Assam Legislative Assembly. This milestone reflects our unwavering commitment to education and our endeavor to create a transformative impact on society.</p>
                        <p>Prior to becoming a university, the Shrimanta Shankar Academy Society had already earned a reputation for excellence through two of its flagship institutions: the Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Management and Technology (GIMT) and the Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Pharmaceutical Science (GIPS). With campuses in Guwahati and Tezpur, Assam, these institutions have consistently delivered high-quality education in engineering, management, and pharmaceutical sciences. GIMT offered AICTE-approved undergraduate and postgraduate programs in engineering and management, while GIPS, recognized by the Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), provided exceptional training in pharmaceutical sciences. Several programs from these institutions were accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), affirming their academic rigor and industry relevance.</p>
                        <p>The elevation of GIMT and GIPS into Girijananda Chowdhury University has created a unified platform to expand our academic horizons. These esteemed institutions now form the School of Engineering and Technology, the School of Management, and the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences under the GCU umbrella. Building on this foundation, GCU has ventured into new domains with the establishment of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the School of Natural Sciences, the School of Allied Health Sciences, and the Centre for Legal Studies. This expansion embodies our commitment to comprehensive education, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary learning.</p>
                        <p>At GCU, we embrace the philosophy that education extends beyond academic boundaries. We believe in nurturing intellectual curiosity, fostering innovation, and encouraging a global perspective among our students. As we march forward, the role of our alumni becomes paramount in shaping the university's legacy. The Girijananda Chowdhury Alumni Association (GCAA) is a vital initiative to strengthen the bond between the institution and its graduates, building a vibrant community that thrives on shared experiences and aspirations.</p>
                        <p>The alumni of GIMT and GIPS, now integral to GCU’s identity, are our greatest ambassadors. Their remarkable achievements across the globe exemplify the transformative power of education and inspire our current students. We warmly invite our alumni to join this collaborative effort by sharing their journeys, expertise, and insights to guide and mentor the next generation of learners. Together, we can become a beacon of hope and opportunity, empowering the youth to achieve their dreams and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
                        <p>As we look to the future, I am confident that GCU will continue to uphold its legacy of academic excellence, innovation, and community engagement. Let us work together to build a university that not only imparts knowledge but also inspires change and fosters leadership.</p>
